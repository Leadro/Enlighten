**Capture** â€“ specifies what elements get captured when recording in window selection mode. Window shadow adds accurate margin with a shadow, desktop background adds current desktop image instead of solid white colour underneath the window.

**Record & playback fps** â€“ the number of frames the recorder captures and the number of frames GIF plays back per second, respectively. Setting lower record fps would reduce file size compared to the same GIF recorded at higher fps, but setting it too low would make the playback look twitchy.

**Repeat count & pause** â€“ the number of times the recorded GIF plays back and for how long it pauses between playbacks.
